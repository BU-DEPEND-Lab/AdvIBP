AdvIBP
========================

*AdvIBP* is a certifed adversarial training method that combines
adversarial training and provable robustness verification. *AdvIBP*
matches or outperforms state-of-art approach, [CROWN-IBP](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Skxuk1rFwB), for provable
L\_infinity robustness on MNIST and CIFAR. The detailed comparison is
shown in Table 1.
